🏥 New Data Analytics Project: Australian Hospital Performance Dashboard 🚀

I built an interactive Power BI dashboard to explore hospital efficiency, patient outcomes, and financial performance in Australia (2021–2025).

🎯 Purpose:
To understand how Australian hospitals are performing across efficiency, patient care, and profitability, and to show how data-driven insights can support better healthcare decisions for administrators, policymakers, and recruiters.

🔍 Key Insights:

NSW & VIC record the highest admissions, reflecting population demand.

Private hospitals achieve higher profits 💰 but report lower patient satisfaction compared to public hospitals.

ED Wait Times worsen in 2024–2025, highlighting system pressure and possible staffing shortages.

Readmission rates for chronic diseases (diabetes, heart) remain high in certain states → need for better preventive care.

Mortality rates are higher in rural states, pointing to regional healthcare access gaps.

📊 Dashboard Features:
✔️ KPI Cards: Avg Wait Time, Readmission %, Mortality, Satisfaction, Profit
✔️ Trends: Line chart (ED Wait Time by Year/State)
✔️ Comparison: Bar charts (Admissions by State & Hospital Type)
✔️ Breakdown: Heatmap (Mortality by State & Year), Donut (Public vs Private share)
✔️ Slicers: Year, State, Hospital Type → full drill-down capability

⚒️ Tech Used: Power BI, Power Query, DAX, Data Modeling, Storytelling with Data
